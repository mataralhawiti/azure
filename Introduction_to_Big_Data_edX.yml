Bg data : high volume, varity, volicty
Big data at rest : it's a pattern in big data world, which is called Batch Processing.
                     One of the principle working  with big data is to try to process it where it is.
                     So, we will run the processing jobs on data in its storage location, doing so we will
                     take advantage parallesim. In other word, we will scale out data processing across multile untits
                     of processing. Those units could be multiple servers of cluster or just logical units.
Big data in motion : which is stream real-time data processing. First, we need to captre the data in reliable way.
                      We have variouse technologies to do so such as queues or hubs.
                      Once we capture the data, we want to do stream processing. Then we either use the result for reporting or store for later.
Lambda architecture : when combine Batch processing with real-time Processing.
Big data technolgies :
  - Azure storage
  - Azure Data lake storage
  - Azure data lake analytics (U-SQL)
  - Azure data factory (orchistration, piplines, workflows)
  - Azure HDInsight
  - Azure Event Hubs or Apach Kafka for data capturing "message broker" real-time data processing.
  - Azure Stream Analytics, Kafka Stream, Apach Spark or Apach Storm  for data processing real-time processing pattern.

Batch processing in Azure : examples in lab
Real-time processing in Azure : examples in lab
Batch processing with HDInsight : Hadoop cluster
Real-time processing with HDInsight : Apach Kafka for message broker, Apache Spark or Apache Storm for data processing.
